# Osteoporosis-diagnosis-using-radiographic-imaging
A multiclass classification analysis was carried out with the goal of identifying the stage of osteoporosis represented in knee X-ray images from different patients. Several convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were proposed as possible solutions to the problem, incorporating techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning.
## Overview
Osteoporosis is one of the most common disorders affecting the knee. It occurs most frequently in individuals over the age of 40 and in postmenopausal women, a period during which there is a drop in hormones important for maintaining bone metabolism balance. The onset of osteoporosis typically begins with the diagnosis of osteopenia, a condition associated with reduced bone mineral density, which makes bones more fragile and prone to fractures. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when both bone mineral density and bone mass decrease, leading to defects in the bone tissue structure that can ultimately result in fractures.

The objective of this project is to analyze a set of knee X-ray images and correctly classify each image according to the disease stage identified in each patient. Several convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed to analyze the images. The first approach involved applying a standard CNN model to the training set to identify initial issues. It was found that the network suffered from overfitting and struggled particularly to correctly classify the osteopenia class. This is likely due to class imbalance in the dataset, as it contains fewer images labeled as osteopenia.

To address this, data augmentation was applied exclusively to the osteopenia class, aiming to balance the dataset. While this improved performance slightly, the results remained limited, achieving a test accuracy of 0.7263, with overfitting still present. A second attempt involved applying data augmentation to the entire training set, which resulted in a training accuracy of 0.6253 and a validation accuracy of 0.6812. In this case, the gap between training and validation accuracy decreased, indicating a reduction in overfitting. However, this model performed worse overall compared to the previous ones.

To improve performance further, transfer learning was applied—specifically feature extraction—using the convolutional layers of the pre-trained VGG-19 model. These layers were used to extract features from the X-ray images, which were then passed into a new neural network for classification.

The main issue across all models was the poor classification of the osteopenia class. This class proved to be the most problematic, as it represents an intermediate disease state. In some patients, it may present with only mild features, making it difficult to distinguish from the normal class, while in others it more closely resembles the osteoporosis stage.

For this reason, a final approach was adopted: combining the osteopenia and osteoporosis classes into a single class, and training a binary classification CNN. This model achieved promising results, with a test accuracy of 0.8477 and high specificity and sensitivity scores.
