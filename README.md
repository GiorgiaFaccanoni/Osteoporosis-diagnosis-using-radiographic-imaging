# Osteoporosis-diagnosis-using-radiographic-imaging
A multiclass classification analysis was carried out with the goal of identifying the stage of osteoporosis represented in knee X-ray images from different patients. Several convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were proposed as possible solutions to the problem, incorporating techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning.
